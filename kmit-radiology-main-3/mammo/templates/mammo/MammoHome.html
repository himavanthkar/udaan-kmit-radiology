                        A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast. It can be
                        used to check for breast cancer in women who have no
                        signs or symptoms of the disease. It can also be used if
                        you have a lump or other sign of breast cancer.The goal
                        of mammography is the early detection of breast cancer,
                        typically through detection of characteristic masses or
                        microcalcifications. Mammograms can be used to check for
                        breast cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of
                        the disease. This type of mammogram is called a
                        screening mammogram. Screening mammograms usually
                        involve two or more x-ray pictures, or images, of each
                        breast. The x-ray images often make it possible to
                        detect tumors that cannot be felt. Screening mammograms
                        can also find microcalcifications (tiny deposits of
                        calcium) that sometimes indicate the presence of breast
                        cancer.

                        Mammograms can also be used to check for breast cancer
                        after a lump or other sign or symptom of the disease has
                        been found. This type of mammogram is called a
                        diagnostic mammogram. Besides a lump, signs of breast
                        cancer can include breast pain, thickening of the skin
                        of the breast, nipple discharge, or a change in breast
                        size or shape; however, these signs may also be signs of
                        benign conditions. A diagnostic mammogram can also be
                        used to evaluate changes found during a screening
                        mammogram or to view breast tissue when it is difficult
                        to obtain a screening mammogram because of special
                        circumstances, such as the presence of breast implants.
                        Early detection of breast cancer with screening
                        mammography means that treatment can be started earlier
                        in the course of the disease, possibly before it has
                        spread. Results from randomized clinical trials and
                        other studies show that screening mammography can help
                        reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among
                        women ages 40 to 74, especially for those over age 50.
